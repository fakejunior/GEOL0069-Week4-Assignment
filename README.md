# GEOL0069: Artificial Intelligence For Earth Observation (AI4EO) 24/25
## Week 4: Collocation and unsupervised classification

This repository showcases my learning experience in working with collocated satellite data and performing unsupervised classification. Through this project, I gained experience in:

*   Finding and accessing collocated satellite imagery (Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2).
*   Handling and processing altimetry data.
*   Implementing and applying unsupervised classification algorithms.

**Learnings:**

*   Understanding the challenges of working with different satellite data resolutions.
*   The importance of data preprocessing for optimal classification results.
*   The practical application of unsupervised learning techniques in remote sensing.
